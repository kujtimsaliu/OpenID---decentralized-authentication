Unfortunately no docker support yet, only local run. Dotnet required to run Authorization and Resource Servers.
Node needed to run React clients.

Follow public documentation to set up environment.

The servers implementation uses self signed TLS, if you see HTTPS error in the logs - run this command on your PC: `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`
